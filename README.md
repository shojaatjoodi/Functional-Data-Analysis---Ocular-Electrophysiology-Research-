# Functional-Data-Analysis---Ocular-Electrophysiology-Research-
This study employs functional data analysis (FDA) to investigate the relationship between pattern electroretinogram (PERG) signals in various ocular diseases with their Visual acuity.

Functional Data Analysis (FDA) entails the statistical examination of data represented as curves or functions. This method focuses on the variation across the entire function over a continuous range, rather than isolated data points. FDA is frequently applied in areas like signal processing, finance, and biology, where data spans a continuous domain.

Key Concepts:

Focus on complete functional curves.
Handles continuous data.
Valuable for time series analysis and curve modeling.
